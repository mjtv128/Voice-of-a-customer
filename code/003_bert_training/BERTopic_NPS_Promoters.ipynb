Sheryl was very helpful and very informative and friendlyThe way the young man questioned me.He was very polite.An easy process and they find really good rates and are easy to communicate with I tried reaching out to individual insurance companies prior to using Policygenius. I found it very difficult to get a timely response from companies. Additionally, it was difficult to compare products. Policygenius quickly responded and answered every question I had along the way. It was easy to make appointments and discuss questions I had about the policies via phone. Excellent customer service! It was a quick and easy process to find myself a cheaper car insurance. The Policygenius team was prompt to reach out and sign me up for my new insurance. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because on the website, it advertised that they would cancel my old insurance, but I was told I needed to do that myself.The rep that I work with was very nice and professional. She addressed all my needs and made sure I understood the questions that I asked her.Karla Contreras did a great job taking care of my insurance needs. She sounds like she really knows what she is doing and found me a great deal.Very knowledgeable agent, friendly and helpful.She really went above and beyond. 5 stars service!!! Excellent customer service, easyI chose 10 because choosing to use Policygenius   would enable me to save half the amount I am currently paying.Agents are very nice and patient and walked me through everything that was best for my needs.when I submitted the coverage I wanted, the first quote came back with the wrong values for Uninsured/underinsured.  I sent it back asking to have that fixed and the next quote came back with that fixed and another value then wrong.   Got it right on the third try.   Now, correspondence, including this email, are saying I got a homeowners quote but I didn't I got car insurance only.   These errors make me a bit nervous!However, it was easy to get a quote and the monthly savings was worth it so I accepted one of the offers.   The process was very easy and the transition went through without any hiccup’s. Also Jeremy was very helpful and helped me with the process tremendously. The way you guys operate makes things like this helpful to me because I have a busy and unpredictable schedule!The service was outstanding.It was very easy to usePatrick has been on top for keeping me up to date in the process It was no hassle made the phone call and got the insuranceIt was simple and easy. Typed in all my info for quotes emailed backed to me and was able to set up a time when someone was gonna call me The agent made it easy and quick he was very professional in the way he presented the different policies and helped me make a good decision on what to choose not just the cheapest but the one that gave me the best coverage.

The team was nice, the process was easy, the price was competitive. Very helpfulFast, knowledgeable, patient, nice!It was simple and effective.Easy process (once we got over my SSN being entered into your system wrong which blocked my access to signing and reviewing documents). Would have been nice if the actual process of applying for life insurance was explained first eg one carrier at a time process vs blanket application to everyone but overall the process was not bad and I was happy with the coverage and premium.Lots of follow up (not too much) and ways to communicate.  Setting up a time to complete the purchase was easy.  Someone who called me during the middle of my evaluation was really helpful to talk about next steps and what I was looking for.  Overall, good experience.Quick and competent service!Simply the besrMoney saving & time saving Your responses to queries and keeping me up-to-date on the progress was outstanding.

Thank you!!Time and money savedGreat way to get quotes without having to go to every insurer around.Excellent customer service. Good follow-up. Delivered a solution to the problem we had. Very impressed.helpful to have a broker help source quotes and manage the underwriting process with the provider. Made things super easy and efficient, and great for staying informed on progress. Only downside in my experience is how there were issues with requesting medical records from my dr despite me submitting my authorization forms multiple times. I know this isn't policygenius' fault but this was a painful part of the process that I wish was handled better in coordination with the life insurance provider and their outsourced medical testing companyI was unhappy with a previous provider who took 8 weeks to deny coverage after minimal communication.  That was contrasted with fast responses and frequent communication about any questions that I had or that came from the insurance company.  It was easy, there was a lot of visibility into the process, and I an very happy with the results.Good service Easiest thing I’ve ever done and I’ve been a life insurance wholesaler for over 20 years. The process was very easy and the quote I received was low. Great service.Policygenius website is great! You can direct access to quotes and plenty of details about each life insurance companies. Great user experience. I only faced a glitch when my info was transferred to the insurance company which made it difficult for them to reach me (explaining the 9 instead of 10). But overall policygenius made the process very easy. I was able to get the coverage I need and probably got the best price. Can you guys please add the same offering for umbrella insurrance and auto insurrance ??Quick & professional service.  Being able to compare prices is an added benefit.Excellent customer service.

This is a true talent and he should get a big raise this year :)Great service, Tyler helped me, always great service from him. \n",

            "Jonathan Cohen Great education materials. Convenient online interactions. Prompt service. It is hard to imagine purchasing long term insurance differently.  Nicolas Mancuso knows his stuff!consistent correspondence and follow up; perseveranceGreat service. Got a good policy. Very helpfulI enjoyed the setup, having a policygenius rep that was able to facilitate the process along the way was a great asset. Minimizing phone calls and maximizing email contact was also important to me. I had a great experience with policygenius. People need to use this vs going through an agent. I'm a financial advisor, but do not sell insurance, as I feel it is a conflict of interest to collect a commission on it, but I will advise them/guide them in using policy genius.I was working with another company on obtaining disability insurance. I ran into multiple problems with this company. After submiting a request to policy genius I was contacted  immediately. Every time I had a question about my policy policy genius answered within the hour. The other company I had to wait days to get my questions answered. Fast and very helpful service. All my questions were answered and I was set up with my disability insurance quickly.Time saverAwesome customer service, at every step of the wayVery professional representatives. I especially liked the communication. I never felt in the dark or lost throughout, and the reps were very knowledgeable of the available policies and riders.

Your did a wonderful communicating what I should look for in a policy, and you were responsive, updating me every step of the way throughout the process.Policy Genius made it simple and straightforward to learn about what insurances I need and apply directly to the policies that work the best for me. I like being able to research those opportunities on my own time and the support available when I need the help.Easy to use and the people that worked there were very helpful.Great follow through and communication Crushed it on the follow through, from my first inquiry online to changing it to monthly payments after it was signedFantastic customer service!Excellent costumer serviceGreat customer service. Very easy to work with.  The team I interacted with were super responsive to my requests and concerns.  The only issue I had was around capturing sensitive data like SSN in clear text which is BIG but it was sanitized immediately on my request It's so far pretty customer oriented and loved the interaction. The only thing that the interaction didn't do well at first are those for multi-family houses where I have to give specifics of the house based on experience. I had to proactively follow up, but other customers might not do that and find themselves disappointed later if not disclosed up front to the agents working on this. It's also helpful to ask the leads for the dec pages as a guide to start somewhere.Great service and guidance from ChrisProvided insights around various quotesPretty easy and simple and I saved a lot of money.

I'm skeptical of all the 'disintermediators' and 'disrupters' in the online marketplace but Policygenius was incredibly helpful and efficient in finding me the best rate for home insurance on a vacation place we purchased in Tucson. I can definitely recommend their service without reservations. I actually secured a homeowner policy that I would not have considered because a quote required engagement with an independent agent. I was able to save half the cost of my current policy.  Very quick service. The people I dealt with were very courteous and prompt. I have already recommended policy genius to friends.Good and prompt service. Too many forms to fill out.  But the overall experience was good.Easy process and nice follow up to keep me on trackVery responsive, timely and professional.This was such an amazingly easy process.  Policy Genius did the work of finding the best fit for my needs and budget, and from start to finish I felt I received excellent customer service.

Other companies never got back to us. I realize it’s a numbers business and you calculate the risk but at least say something. I am not used to online communicators I never met using my first name to communicate with me.  I do not see how that is at all respectful especially when the sender does not even use their name and instead use \"policygenius\"   Those making a living from my payments should always show respect.  Otherwise I am happy with the process.  Thank you \"Poly\" whomever you may be.  Mr. RamseyI was impressed with the follow up by the policy genius agentsI went to company A. They allowed me to fail a portion of their health test. genius set me up with a second company who retested me and gave me a good rate.

I could hear in the background that she was juggling kids as well as taking my call. I was so impressed with her professionalism while also calming down the kiddos. It honestly brightened my day. I have a little one myself and know how difficult it can be to balance home life and work,  especially over the past two years. Taylor displayed the customer facing talent and demeanor that the best companies are competing for. I hope Taylor is recognized for her hard work.Great customer service, extremely knowledgeable staff. Quick to respond to inquiries. Intuitive and simple web app.Very helpful and available.

Received updates through email every step of the way.  Very hassle free.Very helpful and easy to use, informative.Policygenius made finding great rates from a trusted provider very simple and convenient. I gave 9 instead of 10 only because my particular agent was really pushy and didn't seem to understand why I was waiting on signing my policy documents (was waiting to see what my husband's rates would be before I decide how much coverage I would purchase). She sent me many texts, calls, and emails urging me to sign after I explained this to her on a few occasions. I realize she doesn't necessarily reflect the way Policygenius likes to do business so I would still use them again and recommend them to family and friends.

Smooth, timely, competitive, no-hassle process, especially for veteran customers who know exactly what they wantI'm a first time insurance shopper and it's been a confusing and annoying process to say the least. I've talked to 9 different agents who have all told me different things. Sam Ryan from Policygenius was fantastic help. I submitted my quote initially online but it came back with less coverage than I wanted. I called in and Sam helped me add the additional coverage, and walked me through each of my individual quotes, informed me in layman's terms of what each line item was, and provided recommendations based on my situation rather than trying to upsell more coverage. Not only was he the most helpful and least aggressive person I've talked to, but he was also able to secure me the best rates by a long shot compared to anyone else. 10/10, Sam is great, and Policygenius seems like they're doing the insurance thing right.I have already told 4 of my friends about PGI heard about Policygenius through the Ben Shapiro Show podcast.

Then, after the policy was ready, the team was great in helping us clarify and understand all of the provisions.If I could make any suggestion for improvement, there was a bit of confusion initially regarding what the policy provisions would be. Had we been able to clarify more of this up-front, then I would've been able to \"sign on the dotted line\" quicker once the policy was prepared. Overall, though, the experience was great!It was super easy. I appreciated that it continued to prompt and push me towards finalizing. I could be lazy and still get a new policy (saving money in the process). I am now spending 50% less for the same life insurance coverage.Very quick and easy to submit information.

PG was FAR easier to deal with and I felt like I ended up with the right fit for my me and my family (versus being sold products I didn’t feel were necessary).Smooth process.  I did not give a 10 because I only worked with you with regard to life insurance, not other products.  Also, some information provided to me was inconsistent across the various contacts I called.It was an easy way to navigate a complex thing that I’ve been putting off for a long time. Easy, thorough. Follow up and communication (email and over the phone) were great. When we had questions, support was quick to respond with thorough info. We changed our term mid-process and it was no problem. Only small thing is that the support emails would often remove my husband when he was cc-ed on threads. That was only (very small) tweak that would improve an already great service.

If they can help me, why wouldn't they be able to help others?The person I ultimately ended up speaking to on the phone to proceed with getting my policy was very informative and made me feel secure in my decision.

As much as it startled me that my phone rang immediately after submitting my initial inquiry online, it didn't give me an opportunity to procrastinate any further.

Responsive staff, and great communication with the staff at Policygenius.Well, in total I received quotes from 10+ places. But with Policygenius it was a super smooth transaction where I wasn’t heckled with phone calls.I called out of work to talk to the rep, and it was a good idea because the rep was late on the schedule call. Also the policies that PolicyGenius offered are slightly different. It would be nice if we could have quote of the exact coverage amount vs what PolicyGenius offered, instead of a cheapest quote vs alternative quote, which is obviously not a good choice.You guys made it easy and found a great discount for us.  Both of my scheduled meetings were very informative and friendly.The agent was very knowledgeable and thorough with explaining my options.

He took the time to explain both policies. I was a able to do a comparable and to make a few changes prior to signing my documents. A Great Agent! Couldn't have done it without him!They were very helpful and always sending me e-mails about the progress of my policy. They answered all my questions promptly.Excellent service. Very competitive prices!Experience was mostly excellent, although it seemed like there were periods when I didn't hear much, so the process was a bit mysterious to me--perhaps brought on by the near-term rate hike of my existing plans, I wanted to know where I sat and I did't get much feedback during some periods.  Generally, however, I think feedback was periodic although the process seemed to drag on with me wondering what my other options were.  I thought I was very responsive to input, and also of my medical doctor to respond, so perhaps it was just the machinations between PG, Symetra, and their underwriters.  Ultimately it all then came together quickly, and now I have a good policy with a great company.  I'd give a 9.5, but that wasn't an option.I have been please with the service Great speedy service Great service It was easy to use and everyone was polite and friendly.

The whole application experience was fairly simple. I enjoyed an actual person, with a name, checking in on me and relaying updates.

I just haven't had enough feedback from the perspective of my new mortgage company acknowledging the new mortgage provider.  All I've received is that my old coverage is gone and new coverage in place.  State Auto website could be better but that is not an issue with Policygenius.  It's a bit unclear to me what PolicyGenius' role is beyond the initial sale. Another minor caveat that prevented me from giving a perfect 10 rating.I actually stumbled upon your company from a Facebook ad.

Very efficient!!Great communication re: status of application. The process from start to finish was very smooth and simple!I had an excellent experience. I nowhave a life insurence policy.Thank youa really nice company everyone was patient and helpful made the whole process easy to understand good customer servicesGood work, answered all questions Very simple and Policygenius took care of everything. Would highly recommend. Overall experience was excellent the reason for a rating of 9 and not a 10 was during my final acceptance process for the policy i noticed my payment term only listed annually as the payment option and I wanted it to be monthly so the change was made but I had to wait another 7 days because the change required it to go back to the underwriter for the change to be made..it’s hard to believe that just a payment term change was not a administrative function but required an underwriter for approval…Policygenius was a great assistance in helping me find the right life insurance company for me. I had a term policy with another company that wouldn't work out for me on a long term basis, and did not allow me the flexibility of converting without costing me 4 times what I was already paying for my premium.  I now have another term policy which will last me 20 years at an affordable price, and allows me the flexibility to convert before age 65. The agents at policygenius were professional, and gave me exceptional service, answering in detail every question I had moving along with the process of my application until completion.   I'd recommend them to anyone I know.Seemlessfast and great service so far.Good PR, prompt response, courteous, friendly service on the phone and excellent follow up throughout emailGood price.

It's my belief that most people have certain expectations when they contact and engage with a company.

I went a long time without having life insurance.  My husband passed recently and I know how I felt being his beneficiary.  So I thought it was time to get some.  I was reading the financial news and this popped up.  I gave it a try and am so happy I did.  It was a simple process with some corrections, which were handled right away.  Answered some questions.  I received e-mails from one person and then was assigned an agent.  I never talked to these people, but whenever I called in talked to someone new.

They were very informative on my choice of policy.Cause great price not pushy but followed up and got it doneIt is easy to enrole .very profesionalAs a 62 year old man, I was very concerned about my current 20 year life insurance policy coming to an end next month. Hoping to purchase a new 20 year policy, I did tons of research and contacted several insurance companies. Being over 60 years old makes my affordable options fewer. They all wanted me to sign up for a higher rate than I might qualify for....promising me a lower rate if my good health underwriting ended up being as good as I said it was. I recieved quotes for about $200-$299 a month for a 20 year $250,000 policy. Yikes! I didn't want to agree to a higher price up front. I thought, \"Why would an insurance company actually lower the premium, if I had already agreed to a higher premium?\"  I literally prayed about finding a good broker...one that had access to many different insurance companies. Select Quote had some negative reviews, especially for communication and customer service. My prayers were answered when I found Policy Genius. They've been absolutely fantastic!  During my first phone call, I answered all the medical history question very honestly. I'm a healthy guy! I was quoted a super preferred, non-smoker rate of $168 a month, for a 20 year, $300,000 policy with Principle Financial. That's more like it!  Every step of the way I was well informed and updated about every detail. The medical examiner was very kind and thorough. All the paperwork, applications and contracts were sent via email. I was texted and emailed about every step of the timeline. I was able to text any questions I had and I received prompt, courteous replies.  It took a little over a month for the whole process to be completed. Thank you Guang....for being my personal Policy Genius assistant!  You were absolutely wonderful. I qualified for exactly what I was quoted. Now I have an affordable rate and peace of mind for my loved ones! Thank you Policy Genius!super efficient - kept me in the loop through the entire process.They made shopping for life insurance easyEase of use, fast service. Amazing staff; friendly, helpful, patient, and wonderful follow through. They checked in with me regularly without any pressure. Because the team was professional, courteous and kept up to date as the process went along This has been a process where every step along the way there was constant and communication about what was happening, and why.

The web site is laid out very well and easy to navigate. People I have talked to over the phone are polite, courteous, and knowledgeable. My only critique is that the daily contact of messages and phone calls are overbearing. I understand they are trying to make a sale but I it was over a holiday weekend and I didn't want to review anything at that time. Give people a few days between reminders instead of daily.Great reps. Good explanation and overview. Takes the sting and time out of having to shop around. Vetted companies. Probably the only thing that I would maybe like is just more security around sensitive data like ssn and bank accounts. Would be nice to have some secure form to submit that which ends up on the policy form instead of taking it over the phone.

Customer service is outstanding! I would work for Policygenius. Fast, easy.So affordable and you kept me informed every step of the wayIt was a easy process and very economic insurance thank you policy genius I think that the idea of the company is great that none of the people earn commission so they get you what you should really have and not what benefits them. The problem is once you inquire about a policy you get insanely bombarded with emails like one after the other. The other problem was when I got an email regarding someone else’s policy. I called to report it and I ended up getting a second email for this other person. I would hate to have my information sent out like that. It was very worrisome.Great Service The customer service was so much better than the 5 plus other online companies I contacted and exponentially better than any of the locally-based independent brokers/agents I tried to work with.

I have 9 because I will recommend this to my friends/family, but there is room to continue growing. I’d like to see more information about the insurance providers picked — how they were selected, ratings, background; there were two errors when getting the quotes (but got corrected quickly), and I don’t have a solution for this, but in a market with so many telemarketing calls and spammy behavior, I didn’t really know if this was any different — but I am glad I have it a shot.Very informative and courteous service Great experience!happy with the customer service and communication provided and the great rate that was found.Best prices, able to talk to a human.The service provided exceeded expectations.

This is rare.  I have really appreciated her patience with me.Your  personal was quite helpful  and  was  genuinely about  their work. The process was easy and your agents were knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  I liked the fact that your agents did not have to stick to a prescribed dialogue, but could answer my specific questions and checked immediately w/ someone else if they didn’t have the answer themselves. The drawback is that there was a mistake somewhere that resulted in issuing me an auto policy in the wrong state. I suspect it was because of how I had to answer the intake form, which made assumptions that were not correct about where my car is titled. The agents provided me different quote options for my insurance search, and were very patient to explain the meaning of each coverage, and how each coverage item works during the conversation. Easy to schedule the appointment, and great communication through phone conversations or emails. Policygenius provides good starting point for insurance searchKarla was amazing, she was understanding of all my questions and thoroughly walked me through all my coverage and made sure I was not over/under insured.

Very admirable. Matt was very knowledgeable, explained everything in detail, I had no doubts on what to expect. Then Carlos was supremely professional helping set up the policy because my moms native language is not English. But from start to finish, it was all handled very well.

Your ability to help me navigate the policy landscape was great; but honestly, the 10 rating is really attributed to the overall client service experience of your platform. It can be quite difficult to work directly with insurance companies; they typically have poor online user interfaces for clients compared to other financial institutions, such as banks or asset managers, and it's not always worth waiting on hold for a client services rep who may or may not be able to help you.

Everything was done in a single day! This is my second time using Policygenius and I couldn’t be happier!Took a lot of the hassle out of deciding on an insurance carrier and submitting an application. Also great at answering questions and I never had to wait on hold to reach someone. What could be better: confusing to receive calls from you without a voicemail. Didnt know if I should follow up it is you were just checking in. I was also a little put off by receiving a call immediately after submitting my initial application and they started asking for very sensitive information. In a world of fraud, it's surprising to me that there wasn't an assurance that it was actually policy genius calling (like asking me to call you instead). ease of the process to procure a LI and friendly customer serviceYou could beat my current numbersEasily the best experience I’ve had with life insurance Much easier than calling all the insurance carriers for quotesThe entire experience has been extremely insightful.

There is no reason not to use Policygenius!Fast, speedy and professionalism.Easy to use, responsive staff, made this process relatively painlessWas easy to compare prices, nice to get some initial ideas without needing to talk to a person(salesperson), low-pressure, provided good rates. We compared the rates that we were being offered through our Costco Executive membership (for term life), they used Protective, and so when we saw Protective through Policy Genius, and saw that their rate was even lower than through Costco, it was a no brainer. Also, good communication from Policy genius all throughout the whole process of applying and getting approved. Thank you for this service!Great usability and ended up with the rate that I thought I would by the end of the (long) process. Length of the process didn't seem to be any fault of PG.Super easy process all the way through and constant updatesGreat service and support.

Communication about next steps was great, the examiner was very kind, and the process went faster than I expected. My husband applied for both life and disability at the same time, and the disability insurance process hasn't been quite as smooth as the life insurance process. He has received an unreasonable number of emails regarding the disability insurance, which has been frustrating for both of us in trying to keep track of what's going on. We also had to ask for an update to the three quotes we received because none of them were even close to the monthly amount we requested from the very beginning. I have already recommended you to a friend!  Policygenius is a great tool to help whittle down life insurance. Fast, friendly service and no \"glitches\"   I do appreciate all the updates given so I was never in the dark about where my application stood.Speed, follow through, ease of useEasy and saved us money.

Your service and assistance to me has been exceptional and I'll likely use you again.  I put 9 instead of 10 because while I feel comfortable recommending you, it's not the usual topics I discuss with my friends.  I have thought of will likely refer you, however, particularly with family members (am planning on doing so).  Thank you!It was very easy.  I didn't need to talk to anyone until I was very serious about applying.  I'm in good health and was replacing life insurance coverage so not having to take a medical exam was great!

Very  unorganized process, kept asking for same information.  Only got one quote for insurance.  I was told that it was the best fit for me.  I believe it was the best profit for you.  I will be getting other quotes before paying next premium.You got me good insurance for a great price quickly.  That’s all I could ask for. different agents told me different things, so not totally consistent. Also, according to two agents, I would get a call and make changes to the first policy, before they send it to me.  That didn't happen, I received the policy.  I called several times, about this and that.  Fiinally, I called. to make the changes wanted over the phone.  a few days later was advised the policy will be coming with the updated changes 'soon'.  I understand that was on Prudential.  Overall, all the agents were very helpful, and pleasant, either phone or email.  So, basically, if all of the agents were advising the same information, you would have had a ten. I'd been putting this off because I've been swarmed with phone calls before when I made an inquiry or filled out a form about car insurance in the past. But you all were respectful and helpful, answered all my questions. I even got a better rate on term life than I expected. So all good!Prompt and attentive service!Very professional, consistent and pleasant experience all around.  Policygenius had the best customer service of the 4 groups I was working with. Professional, knowledgeable and friendly staff made the process easy .

My experience with Policygenius was the best! Everyone I communicated with via phone, email or text was polite and efficient and I felt the team was really stayed on top of my application through every step of the process. This was such a refreshing change from so much of today's mediocre and plain awful business practice where you feel like you're wondering if anyone cares and you have to stay on top of everyone (e.g. mortgage applications ,etc.) to make sure everything is moving along.

Excellent process - low- or no-pressure, mostly online, responsive. Who needs a life insurance agent?Easy to use, communicated regularly and effectively Fantastic process that was clear, simple and had someone to walk me through every step of the way. Got me the best rate for the term i was asking. Very easy process. Helpful staff, good website. Made getting a new term policy pretty simple.Friendly people but when they had set a time to call they didn't. Super easy, quick, precise and I never felt pressured.Great service, easy to work with, good pricingI had gone through my current insurance provider to receive a term life insurance quote, thinking that my agent of several years would have my best interests in mind. When I submitted an application through her office, she refused to submit it for a preferred rate saying \"Oh, I always submit these at average so that you don't get disappointed when the quote comes back at a higher rate,' which was a giant red flag. The quote, of course, was approved for an average rate of $45 a month, which seemed ridiculously high for someone like me who is in generally good health. After going through Policygenius, I was able to quickly secure the same amount of coverage at the preferred plus level for only $14 a month with another insurer. It is clear that my current agent only cares about the bottom line while Policygenius actually wants to help people get the best rate they can for the coverage they need. As a result, I plan on leaving my current agent/insurer behind and using Policygenius to help me find better coverage across the board. Easy to use and provides sound adviceYou guys did work and kept in communication during the whole process. You found me the best rate. Easy convenient cost effective Very courteous and professional help. Very easy process.Insurance agents were very helpful.

The team was really communicative. The CX felt high touch and human despite being tech-forward. You got me a great rate We had an overall good experience - the only issue we had is that the person who set us up initially scheduled a medical exam for me and said we should have my husband seen at the same time since both policies were being applied for simultaneously. I agreed and set up a time for both of us. When the nurse arrived, she only had orders for me so we had to do a bit of extra work to find/transfer the orders for my husband so she would not have to come back again.

Good communication Very reliable source and customer satisfaction.Thanks JeffVery prompt in response and helpfulConvenient Policygenius was very thorough in guiding me step by step through the process of buying my life insurance.  They shared all necessary information before and during the Underwriting process,  and kept consistent communication on how the policy was being reviewed and approved.  And very friendly team! Fairly simplified process through Policygenius.  My only real complaint has to do with the insurance carriers' pervasive habit of quoting a low number to attract business, only to replace it with a higher premium for any number of reasons after-the-fact.  The ability of the carriers to provide accurate (read as: unchanging) quotes is paramount in your industry.  Rather than view the quote as a \"sales opportunity,\" emphasis should be placed on accuracy.  No one likes to receive a higher premium number after completing so many steps toward purchasing a policy (like a medical exam).  It may be tempting to respond by saying, \"we do not know the accurate premium until after all the verification steps are complete.\"  To which I reply, \"try harder.\"  It is the who nature of this business.  That being said, I enjoyed my experience with Policygenius.convenienceYou guys made my process easy. Thank you so much. The simple communication and very easy to work with and helpful staff makes a recommendation a priority of mine and I already have.Very helpful and prompt to answer or help assist with any questions/issues ! The insurance industry is confusing, I believe it's by design; and because pricing is individualized it's easy for companies to raise premiums with no actual reason. Having someone, like Policygenius, who is willing to work on my behalf to find AND who understands how the industry operates is quite valuable to me.Very helpful during the whole process. They kept me updated while I was waiting for responses from TransAmerica.Good insurance options.Cheap premiums for a good coverageGreat customer service, on top of things from start to finish, very smooth process Ease of use PriceCustomer serviceConvenient channels to answer questions (direct phone lines and email), quick response times, nice employees who took the time to answer questions and make this process seem less overwhelming!made it very easy for meEasy, no hassles, no concerns about security or underhanded tactics, no attempts to advertise and push specific providers.Please expand and do more advertising so more people can use Policygenius to find policies. Obamacare rollout might have been more successful if they had you servicing it instead of the stupid marketplace they haphazardly threw together.Easy process It was organized and efficient . The process was easy to navigate and I appreciate the continued updates along the way. Thanks so much guys ! Very responsive and no wait time on the phone. Friendly yet customized to my needs. Insurance jargon isn’t easy for anyone and it is good to know someone is on my side and I don’t have to pay them directly. Easy and painless process. great service, and best prices.Easy and Quick!

He was personable, friendly, and we shared a few laughs along the way. Great experience!Great quotes, easy process on your own pace. The disadvantage is that sometime you don't get a response to your emails, it seems like if they were re-assigned within a pool of agents and the follow up is not as consistent..easy intelligent service that saved me money Very responsive and helpful and saved me a significant amount of moneyYour agent Jeremy provided an outstanding service. He was very helpful in all my questions and needs. Congratulations!Very easy to use and the customer service was great.Fast, Friendly, helpful to all my needs and questions.

They did all the leg work for me.Policygenuis has made finding home and automobile insurance a piece of cake. They even cancelled my old policy  for me. I would recommend to anyone. Very helpful and greatservice Helpful in comparing insurance companies. The follow up emails were slightly excessive though.

Easy to use, and compares across many companies so that the customer is getting enough options.Quick response, informative quotes, great customer service.I have no complaints.

She was awesome and I would like to make sure that her superiors are aware.Agent was really patient with answering my questions and comparing options.ResultsIt was so easy and helpfulVery simple process.  Great follow up.  Then finalized everything with someone from my area named Andrew.  The policy signing was easy.  The payment process was easy.  Very good job.Good quotes, expert and friendly agent, and quick response. The only thing to fix is that Madison informed me that I would be billed for the new home insurance policy around the effective date, which is 2/18 in this instance. However, I was billed 1/31 for the new policy. It’s not a big deal to me since I am ok to make the payment, but it seems to be a misunderstanding on your side and requires better clarity. It has saved a lot of time and money by working with Policygenius.Easy and information was presented well. Had a slight delay in getting quotes. But when I reached out PG responded very quickly. Tara was amazing and efficient and very easy to work with. I have had to get quotes from other companies and found the process to be very time consuming and arduous.

Very good experience 👌 Our son Brad Ehilegbu recommended shopping with Policy Genius as we are transitioning from N.C. to S.C. So, we went onto your website and entered in our information and was paired up with Christopher Domingo. He gave us excellent service and recommendations. He also followed up with us quickly and assertively. Both Christopher and Brad went the extra mile to ensure our needs were met, and so happy we made the switch. Kudos to both!!!The representative was very helpful answering all my questions and looking into getting me the best pricesGreat conversation with Christian, he answered all my questions, made the process seamlessProvides a useful service when looking at quotes from various insurance companies.They literally handled all the quote comparisons and dealing with the insurance company with little to no effort from myself. Super easy.The tram was very responsive and helpful. I had a question after the policies were set up, and I found a customer service number. The best thing? Someone answered the phone promptly! Also, I did end up saving a bunch of money, so that’s very helpful. It would have taken me a lot of effort to comparison shop insurance across home, auto, and umbrella. Outsourcing this to a third party is... genius.Painless experience. Agent answered my questions fully, provided options and quickly had me back to my day. I avoided shopping for insurance despite knowing I was overpaying for years. Wish I knew about Policy Genuis sooner!Received great rates.
